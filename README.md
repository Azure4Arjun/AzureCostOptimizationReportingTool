# Azure Cost Optimization Reporting Tool
The Azure Cost Optimization Reporting Tool (ACORT) is a free, open-source tool designed to improve the cost efficiency of your Azure deployments. It performs a multi-subscription assessment of your Azure resources against Microsoft's cost optimization best practices defined in the [Well-Architected Framework](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/framework/cost/) and [Cloud Adoption Framework](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/get-started/manage-costs). A recurring email report is generated containing optimizations for each subscription with associated cost data pulled from the previous month.

* Assess your Azure workloads against 25 Microsoft cost optimization best practices scoped to subscriptions, management groups, or the entire tenant.
* Get an efficiency score for each subscription and total cost optimization potential ($).
* Receive a recurring (weekly or monthly) email report.
* Leverage cost data to understand optimization potential and determine remediation priority.
* Includes all Azure Advisor recommendations.
